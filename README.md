# AUT Workshop 2020 

This is a repository for a workshop on ALA (https://abstractionlayeredarchitecture.com)

The code is a Hello world program in ALA and C# for Visual Studio on Windows.

It contains the ALA layer folders:

* Application
* Domain Abstractions
* Programming Paradigms
* Library.

Inside the Application folder is the Hello world program, which we will modify for various exercises.

Inside the Domain Abstractions folder are a few abstractions for us to use in the exercises.


## Getting started

1. If you don't already have Visual Studio, install Visual Studio from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com for C# development on a Windows PC.

2. If you don't already have git installed, install Git from https://git-scm.com/download/win. It is best to use Git to clone the repository because then you can contribute your changes back to the repository. However, if you can't make Git work through a firewall, you can download a zip file from this repository.

3. Create a folder on your PC. Open a Git Bash terminal in the folder and clone the repository with the command
```
$ git clone https://github.com/john-spray/AUTWorkshop2020.git
```
    Alternatively, unzip the downloaded zip file into the folder.

4. Double click the file ALASandbox.sln, which will open in Visual Studio.

5. Press F5 to run the Hello world program
